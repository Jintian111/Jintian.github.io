          Schoen-Yau-Shick (SYS) manifold to non-compact case, and give some examples of

      In this talk, we show that if the mean curvature of a closed smooth embedded mean

          singular time converges smoothly to a self-shrinker flow with multiplicity one. 
          This result confirms Ilmanen's multiplicity-one conjecture under the assumption 
          that the mean curvature is of type-I. As a corollary, we show that the mean curvature 
          at the first singular time of a closed smooth embedded mean curvature flow in $R^3$ is at 
          least of type-I. This is joint work with Bing Wang.

       Mean curvature flow (MCF) has been widely studied in recent decades,

          multiplicity $2$, respectively. Additionally, we will compare our example

        </span>
        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
       In this talk, we discuss the approach of Mean Curvature Flow 
          to demonstrate that area non-increasing maps between certain 
          positively curved closed manifolds are rigid. Specifically, this 
          implies that an area non-increasing self-map of $CP^n$, $n \geq 2$, is 
          either homotopically trivial or is an isometry, answering a question 
          by Tsai-Tsui-Wang. Moreover, by coupling the Mean Curvature Flow for 
          the graph of a map with Ricci Flows for the domain and the target, 
          we can also study the rigidity of area non-increasing maps from closed 
          manifolds with positive 1-isotropic curvature (PIC1) to closed Einstein manifolds, 
          where Prof. Brendle’s PIC1 Sphere Theorem is applied. The key to studying the
          rigidity of area non-increasing maps under various curvature conditions lies in 
          the application of the Strong Maximum Principle along the MCF/MCF-RF. We will focus 
          our attention on one particular case to illustrate the SMP argument. This is a joint 
          work with Professor Man-Chun Lee and Professor Luen-Fai Tam from CUHK.

          <!--Abstract-->
       Steady Ricci solitons are fundamental objects inthe study of Ricci 
          flow, as they are self-similar solutions and often arise 
          assingularity models. Classical examples of steady solitons are 
          the most symmetric ones, such as the 2D cigar soliton, the 
          $O(n)$-invariant Bryant solitons, and Cao’s $U(n)$-invariant 
          Kahler steady solitons. Recently we constructed a family of 
          flying wing steady solitons in any real dimension $n≥3$, which 
          confirmed a conjecture by Hamilton in $n=3$. In dimension $3$, 
          we showed allsteady gradient solitons are $O(2)$-symmetric. 
          In the Kahler case, we also construct a family of Kahler flying 
          wing steady gradient solitons with positive curvature for any 
          complex dimension $n≥2$, which answers a conjecture by H.-D.Cao 
          in the negative. This is partly collaborated with Pak-Yeung Chan 
          and Ronan Conlon.

        </span>
        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
       Motivated by the solution of the aspherical conjecture up to dimension $5$ by Chodosh-Li and Gromov, 
          we introduce a relative version of the aspherical conjecture. More precisely, we seek to explore 
          the impact of a codimension $k$ submanifold $X$ on the existence of PSC (Positive Scalar Curvature) 
          of the ambient space $Y$,  under the relative aspherical condition that $\pi_i(Y,X) = 0, 2\leq i\leq k$. 
          The formulation of the conjecture genralizes the aspherical conjecture and Rosenberg $S^1$ stability conjecture 
          into a single framework, and is closely related to codim $2$ obstruction results by Hanke-Pape-Schick and 
          Cecchini-Rade-Zeidler. In codim $3$ and $4$, we show how $3$-manifold obstructs the existence of PSC under our 
          relative aspherical condition, the proof of which relies on a newly introduced geometric quantity called the spherical 
          width. These results could be regarded as a relative version extension of the aspherical conjecture up to dim $5$.

        <span class="abstract">
          <!--Abstract-->
       It is well known that the semi-linear elliptic Allen-Cahn equation arising 
          in phase transition theory is closely related to the theory of minimal 
          surfaces. Earlier works of Modica and Sternberg et. al in the 1970’s studied 
          minimizing solutions in the framework of De Giorgi’s Gamma-convergence theory. 
          The more profound regularity theory for stationary and stable solutions were 
          obtained by the deep work of Tonegawa and Wickramasekera, building upon the 
          celebrated Schoen-Simon regularity theory for stable minimal hypersurfaces. 
          This is recently used by Guaraco to develop a new approach to min-max constructions 
          of minimal hypersurfaces via the Allen-Cahn equation. In this talk, we will discuss 
          about the boundary behaviour for limit interfaces arising in the Allen-Cahn equation 
          on bounded domains (or, more generally, on compact manifolds with boundary). 
          In particular, we show that, under uniform energy bounds, any such limit interface 
          is a free boundary minimal hypersurface in the generalised sense of varifolds. 
          Moreover, we establish the up-to-the-boundary integer rectifiability of the limit 
          varifold. If time permits, we will also discuss what we expect in the case of stable 
          solutions. This is on-going joint work with Davide Parise (UCSD) and Lorenzo Sarnataro 
          (Princeton). This work is substantially supported by research grants from Hong Kong 
          Research Grants Council and National Science Foundation China.

          <!--Abstract-->
       The classical Llarull theorem states that a smooth metric on $n$-sphere cannot 
          have scalar curvature no less than $n(n-1)$ and dominate the standard spherical 
          metric at the same time unless it is the standard spherical metric. In this talk, 
          we prove that Llarull's rigidity theorem holds for $L^{\infty}$ metrics on spheres 
          with finitely many points punctured. This is a joint work with Prof. Jianchun Chu and Prof. Man-Chun Lee.
